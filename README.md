# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
Welcome to the Prework Study Guide Webpage, where I aim to equip myself and other learners with essential skills needed to excel in their coding journey.
The motivation for creating this project was to help learners prepare effectively for the EdX Fullsyack Coding Bootcamps, however my hope is it will be a supportive tool for all learners.
The problem I aim to solve with this study guide is to provide a structured accessible approach to common coding commands and rules. 
Through this project, I learned how to structure learning content effectively, create an easy to navigate study guide, and provide clear explanations for technical commands. 
In summary, my Prework Study Guide webpage aims to help learners build a strong foundation in coding by providing them with a structured accessible approach to common coding commands.
